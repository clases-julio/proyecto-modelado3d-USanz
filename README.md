# proyecto-modelado3d-USanz

# Description
This is a model of a robot with 2 axis and two wheels for each one.
Thanks to the [practice 3](https://github.com/clases-julio/p3-pythonscripting-USanz) we have a program that makes the robot wheels and axes for us, and the best part of it is that we can change sizes and colors of the wheels and the axis, and we can even change the distance between those axes.
To see more information about how to change these parameters see the practice 3 [README.md](https://github.com/clases-julio/p3-pythonscripting-USanz#readme) file.
